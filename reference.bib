    abstract = {{As networks of computing devices grow larger and more complex, the need for highly accurate and scalable network simulation technologies becomes critical. Despite the emergence of large-scale testbeds for network research, simulation still plays a vital role in terms of scalability (both in size and in experimental speed), reproducibility, rapid prototyping , and education . With simulation based studies, the approach can be studied in detail at varying scales, with varying data applications, varying field conditions, and will result in reproducible and analyzable results.}},
